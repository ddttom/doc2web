# doc2web Architecture

## 1. Overview

doc2web is a Node.js application that converts Microsoft Word documents (.docx) to web-friendly formats (HTML and Markdown) while preserving the original document's styling and structure. This document provides a detailed technical explanation of how the application parses DOCX files and generates the corresponding web content.

The application is designed to be generic, content-agnostic, and document-structure-driven. It analyzes DOCX files based on their XML structure rather than making assumptions about specific content patterns or terms. All formatting decisions are based on document styles, not text content.

## 2. Application Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture organized into logical function groups:

```bash

## 3. DOCX File Structure

A DOCX file is essentially a ZIP archive containing various XML files that describe the document's content, styles, and metadata. Understanding this structure is crucial for parsing DOCX files effectively.

### 3.1 Key XML Files

The application extracts and processes the following XML files from the DOCX archive:

1. **word/document.xml**
   - Contains the main content of the document
   - Includes paragraphs, runs (text segments), tables, and other content elements
   - References styles and numbering definitions by ID
   - Contains tracked changes information (insertions, deletions, formatting changes)

2. **word/styles.xml**
   - Contains style definitions
   - Includes paragraph styles, character styles, table styles, and list styles
   - Defines properties like fonts, sizes, colors, indentation, etc.

3. **word/numbering.xml**
   - Contains numbering definitions for lists
   - Defines the format, indentation, and text of each level in a list
   - Referenced by paragraphs that are part of lists

4. **word/theme/theme1.xml**
   - Contains theme information (colors, fonts)
   - Referenced by styles to apply consistent theming

5. **word/settings.xml**
   - Contains document-wide settings
   - Includes default tab stops, character spacing, etc.
   - Contains track changes settings and revision information

6. **docProps/core.xml**
   - Contains core document metadata
   - Includes title, subject, author, keywords, created date, modified date, etc.
   - Follows Dublin Core metadata standard

7. **docProps/app.xml**
   - Contains application-specific metadata
   - Includes application name, company, revision count, etc.

### 3.2 XML Namespaces

The XML files in DOCX use several namespaces to organize elements and attributes. The application handles these namespaces using a custom XPath utility that registers the following namespaces:

```javascript
const NAMESPACES = {
  w: 'http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main',
  a: 'http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main',
  r: 'http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships',
  m: 'http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/math',
  v: 'urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml',
  wp: 'http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/wordprocessingDrawing',
  mc: 'http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006'
};
```

## 4. Core Processing Flow

The main processing flow of the application consists of the following steps:

1. **Input Processing**
   - Determine input type (single file, directory, or list file)
   - Validate input files (check if they are .docx files)
   - Create output directories mirroring the input structure

2. **DOCX Parsing**
   - Unpack the DOCX file (which is a ZIP archive)
   - Extract and parse key XML files (document.xml, styles.xml, etc.)
   - Extract style information, theme, numbering definitions, etc.

3. **HTML Generation**
   - Convert DOCX content to HTML using mammoth.js with custom style mapping
   - Enhance the HTML with proper structure and styling
   - Process special elements like TOC and hierarchical lists

4. **CSS Generation**
   - Generate CSS from the extracted style information
   - Create external CSS file linked from the HTML

5. **Image Extraction**
   - Extract images from the DOCX file
   - Save them in an images directory
   - Update image references in the HTML

6. **Markdown Conversion** (optional)
   - Convert the HTML to well-structured Markdown
   - Fix common Markdown formatting issues

7. **Output Organization**
   - Save all generated files in the appropriate output directories
   - Maintain the original directory structure

## 5. DOCX Parsing Process

### 5.1 Document XML Parsing

The application uses JSZip to extract XML files from the DOCX archive and xmldom's DOMParser to parse the XML into a DOM structure. The parsed XML is then processed using XPath queries to extract relevant information.

```javascript
// Extract key files
const styleXml = await zip.file('word/styles.xml')?.async('string');
const documentXml = await zip.file('word/document.xml')?.async('string');
const themeXml = await zip.file('word/theme/theme1.xml')?.async('string');
const settingsXml = await zip.file('word/settings.xml')?.async('string');
const numberingXml = await zip.file('word/numbering.xml')?.async('string');
const corePropsXml = await zip.file('docProps/core.xml')?.async('string');
const appPropsXml = await zip.file('docProps/app.xml')?.async('string');

// Parse XML content
const styleDoc = new DOMParser().parseFromString(styleXml);
const documentDoc = new DOMParser().parseFromString(documentXml);
const themeDoc = themeXml ? new DOMParser().parseFromString(themeXml) : null;
const settingsDoc = settingsXml ? new DOMParser().parseFromString(settingsXml) : null;
const numberingDoc = numberingXml ? new DOMParser().parseFromString(numberingXml) : null;
const corePropsDoc = corePropsXml ? new DOMParser().parseFromString(corePropsXml) : null;
const appPropsDoc = appPropsXml ? new DOMParser().parseFromString(appPropsXml) : null;
```

### 5.2 Style Extraction

The application extracts style information from the parsed XML using XPath queries and custom parsing functions. The extracted information includes:

1. **Paragraph Styles**
   - Font family, size, weight, style
   - Alignment, indentation, spacing

## 8. Special Element Handling

### 8.1 Table of Contents (TOC)

The application carefully processes TOC elements to maintain their structure and styling:

#### 8.1.1 TOC Detection

- Identify TOC entries based on style or content pattern
- Create a TOC container if not already present
- Group TOC entries by level

#### 8.1.2 TOC Structure

- Create spans for text, dots, and page numbers
- Apply appropriate classes for styling
- Maintain hierarchical structure with proper indentation

#### 8.1.3 TOC Styling

- Style the TOC container and heading
- Style TOC entries with proper indentation
- Create leader dots using CSS background images
- Align page numbers to the right

#### 8.1.4 Enhanced TOC Layout Implementation (v1.2.2)

The TOC layout has been enhanced with a flex-based approach that ensures proper alignment and spacing:

1. **Flex Container Structure**:
   - Each TOC entry is a flex container with `display: flex`
   - Text content has `flex-grow: 0` to maintain its natural size
   - Dots section has `flex-grow: 1` to fill available space
   - Page numbers have `flex-grow: 0` with `text-align: right`

2. **Leader Dots Implementation**:
   - Leader dots are created using CSS `background-image` with a radial gradient
   - The pattern is precisely controlled to match Word's leader dot spacing
   - This approach ensures consistent appearance across browsers
   - The implementation uses a repeating pattern like:
     ```css
     .docx-toc-dots {
       background-image: radial-gradient(circle, #000 1px, transparent 1px);
       background-size: 8px 8px;
       background-position: bottom;
       background-repeat: repeat-x;
     }
     ```

3. **Page Number Alignment**:
   - Page numbers are right-aligned within their container
   - This ensures consistent positioning regardless of page number length
   - The alignment is maintained even with different font sizes

4. **Column Layout Prevention**:
   - Explicit `column-count: 1` is applied to the TOC container
   - This prevents browsers from automatically creating multi-column layouts
   - Ensures the TOC appears as a single column, matching Word's presentation

5. **Vertical Stacking**:
   - Enhanced display properties ensure proper vertical stacking of TOC entries
   - Each entry is a block-level element with appropriate margins
   - Hierarchical indentation is preserved through margin-left values

This implementation ensures that the TOC in the HTML output closely resembles the appearance of the original Word document, providing a professional and polished look.

### 8.2 Hierarchical Lists

The application processes hierarchical lists to maintain their structure and numbering:

#### 8.2.1 List Detection

- Identify list items based on numbering properties
- Group list items into logical lists
- Detect nested lists and their levels

#### 8.2.2 List Structure

- Create ordered or unordered lists as appropriate
- Maintain proper nesting for hierarchical lists
- Create list items with proper attributes
- Apply exact numbering from DOCX definitions

#### 8.2.3 List Styling

- Apply CSS counters for automatic numbering
- Style different list levels appropriately
- Handle special cases like different numbering formats
- Generate CSS that exactly matches DOCX numbering formats
- Support complex multi-level formats (e.g., "1.1.1", "Article 1.a")

#### 8.2.4 Enhanced Paragraph Numbering Implementation (v1.2.2)

The paragraph numbering system has been enhanced to provide exact visual fidelity:

1. **Data Attribute Approach**:
   - Numbered elements receive `data-numbering-id`, `data-numbering-level`, and `data-format` attributes
   - This approach separates content from presentation
   - Prevents potential conflicts or duplicate numbering
   - The HTML structure looks like:
     ```html
     <h1 data-numbering-id="2" data-numbering-level="0" data-format="%1.">Heading Text</h1>
     ```

2. **CSS ::before Implementation**:
   - Numbers are displayed using CSS `::before` pseudo-elements
   - Content is generated using CSS counters that match DOCX numbering definitions
   - This ensures exact replication of Word's numbering formats
   - The CSS implementation looks like:
     ```css
     [data-numbering-id="2"][data-numbering-level="0"] {
       position: relative;
       counter-increment: level1;
     }
     [data-numbering-id="2"][data-numbering-level="0"]::before {
       content: counter(level1) ".";
       position: absolute;
       left: -24pt;
       width: 24pt;
       box-sizing: border-box;
     }
     ```

3. **Positioning Technique**:
   - The parent element has `position: relative`
   - The `::before` pseudo-element uses `position: absolute`
   - Left positioning is calculated based on indentation values from DOCX
   - Width is explicitly set to ensure proper text flow
   - This approach ensures exact positioning that matches Word's layout

4. **Indentation and Spacing**:
   - `marginLeft`, `paddingLeft`, and `textIndent` are calculated from DOCX properties
   - These values ensure exact matching of Word's paragraph layout
   - Hanging indents are properly implemented for numbered paragraphs
   - The calculation takes into account:
     - `levelDef.indentation.left`: The overall left indentation
     - `levelDef.indentation.hanging`: The hanging indent amount
     - `levelDef.indentation.firstLine`: The first line indent amount

5. **Counter Reset Strategy**:
   - Counter reset is applied at appropriate levels to maintain hierarchical structure
   - Each level properly increments its own counter
   - Hierarchical numbering strings are constructed using the appropriate format
   - Level-specific styling ensures visual consistency with the original document

This implementation ensures that numbered paragraphs in the HTML output exactly match the appearance of the original Word document, maintaining the document's structural integrity and professional formatting.

### 8.3 Language-Specific Elements

The application handles language-specific elements:

1. **RTL Text**
   - Detect right-to-left text direction
   - Apply appropriate directionality attributes
   - Style RTL elements with proper CSS

## 14. Conclusion

The doc2web application provides a robust solution for converting DOCX documents to web-friendly formats while preserving styling and structure. By analyzing the document's XML structure rather than its content, the application remains generic and content-agnostic, working effectively with any document regardless of its domain or purpose.

The enhanced implementation now includes comprehensive accessibility features ensuring WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, detailed metadata extraction and preservation, robust track changes handling, exact numbering preservation, and reliable DOM serialization. These enhancements make the application suitable for professional and enterprise environments where accessibility, metadata, revision tracking, and precise document structure are critical requirements.

The application now features advanced numbering extraction and resolution capabilities that ensure exact preservation of DOCX numbering formats in the HTML and CSS output. The numbering-resolver.js module maps paragraphs to their numbering definitions and resolves actual sequential numbers based on document position, handling complex hierarchical numbering with proper nesting and sequence.

Additionally, the implementation includes comprehensive DOM serialization verification to ensure content preservation during HTML processing. This addresses potential issues with empty body content, browser-specific serialization differences, and structure integrity, providing fallback mechanisms and detailed logging for debugging purposes.

The modular architecture and clear separation of concerns make the codebase maintainable and extensible, while the comprehensive error handling ensures reliable operation even with complex or problematic documents. The recent fixes have significantly improved the reliability and robustness of the application, particularly in handling complex documents with extensive DOM manipulation requirements.

The v1.2.2 release further enhances the visual fidelity of the generated HTML output, with particular focus on TOC formatting and paragraph numbering. The flex-based layout for TOC entries and CSS ::before implementation for paragraph numbering ensure that the output closely matches the appearance of the original Word document, providing a professional and polished presentation.
